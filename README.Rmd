`pythonR` includes helper functions for using Python in R. It is essentially a wrapper of the `reticulate` R package, and can helpful in an R package development or project environment where you want more readable code for setting up a python environment and installing any necessary python dependencies.


You begin by setting up a python environment (conda or virtual) with the required imports you will need:
```{r}
## With a conda environment (the default) ##
# much faster loading time after you've installed the packages once
py_env <- setup_py_env(py_pkgs = c("pandas", "numpy", "scipy"))
py_env

# Put the conda environment under a specific name if you want to store multiple
# note: you must restart your R session if you've already generated an environment
py_env <- setup_py_env(
  py_pkgs = c("pandas", "numpy", "scipy"),
  conda_name = PYTHON_R_ENV,
  update = TRUE
)

## Using a virtual environment ##
py_env <- setup_py_env(py_pkgs = c("pandas", "numpy", "scipy"), py_env = "virtual")
py_env

# shutdown virtual environment
shutdown_virtual_env(py_env$env_name)

```

Note that you can always install packages to the environment you created at a later time:
```{r}
# Installing a package after setup (works with both environment types)
py_env <- setup_py_env(py_pkgs = c("pandas", "numpy"))
install_py_pkgs(py_pkgs = c('scipy'), env_name = py_env$env_name)
```


Additional helper functions are provided for ensuring required python packages are installed or importing them at various stages within an R function/script. A simple example is provided below, but see `?pythonR_examples` for fully fleshed out examples and more details.


```{r}
my_py_function <- function(){
  # Check that python packages are installed
  required_py_pkgs <- c('pandas', 'scipy', 'numpy')
  checkmate::assert_true(check_py_pkgs_installed(required_py_pkgs))
  
  # import main python modules
  import_main_py()
  
  # import required python packages
  import_py_pkgs(py_pkgs = required_py_pkgs)
  
  # source python script or load python functions into R
  
  # do something...
}
```


```{r}
# Set up a python environment once per R session
py_env <- setup_py_env(
  py_pkgs = c("pandas", "numpy", "scipy"),
  py_env = "conda"
)

# Use any python functions coded in R
my_py_function()
```
