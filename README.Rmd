`pythonR` includes helper functions for using Python in R. It is essentially a wrapper of the `reticulate` R package, and can helpful in an R package development or project environment where you want more readable code for setting up a python environment and installing any necessary python dependencies.

Install the latest development version:
```{r}
devtools::install_github("barrettk/pythonR")
```


See the [Getting Started](https://barrettk.github.io/pythonR/articles/getting-started.html) vignette for more details.
