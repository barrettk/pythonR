`pythonR` is an R package that facilitates the seamless integration of Python code and functionality within R environments. Leveraging the `reticulate` package, `pythonR` aims to simplify the process of developing Python-based functions in R, making it easier to set up, test, and validate Python code directly within the R environment.

## Features

- Provides a convenient wrapper for using Python in R, reducing the overhead of managing Python environments.
- Simplifies the installation and management of required Python packages from within R.
- Offers functions for importing Python modules and executing Python code directly from R scripts or functions.
- Exports [example](https://barrettk.github.io/pythonR/reference/pythonR_examples.html) python-based functions

## Getting Started

Install the latest development version from GitHub:
```{r}
devtools::install_github("barrettk/pythonR")
```

See the [Getting Started](https://barrettk.github.io/pythonR/articles/getting-started.html) vignette for more details.
