`pythonR` includes helper functions for using Python in R. It is
essentially a wrapper of the `reticulate` R package, and can helpful in
an R package development or project environment where you want more
readable code for setting up a python environment and installing any
necessary python dependencies.

Install the latest development version:

``` r
devtools::install_github("barrettk/pythonR")
```
